# boards
These are boards I reverse engineer for my own understading. Not sure if sharing this info via github repos is t he way to go, but let's give it a try.

Whenever possible, attribution to the board's creator will be given. Many of these tiny boards I buy are some kind cheap clone or nameless knockoff. These will be "by unknown". If anyone knows the origin of a baord covered here, please create an issue with the attribution or anecdotes.
